**this_doggo**
=======
Twitter bot made with Python and Tweepy

Summoning
--
 To summon just tweet @this_doggo with one of the 6 hashtags:

	* #americanbulldog
	* #britishbulldog
	* #frenchbulldog
	* #goldenretriever
	* #labradorretriever
	* #germanshepherd
 The bot should respond with an image of the correspondent dog, if there are multiple # it will respond to each individually

Requirements
--
 There is a requirements.txt but all you really need is Tweepy

Environment variables
--
 You need to set them up in your os with the twitter API keys from  [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en)

Roadmap
--
There are 3 main features that for me are the most important to implement:

* Expand the breeds of dogs supported
* Broaden the image library to ~20 per breeds
* Image recognition to identify breeds when summoned

These will be implemented slowly as I learn web scraping and neural networks.
